# SMILES2DTA(DTC)\_Demo

ðŸ”¬ **SMILES2DTA(DTC)\_Demo** is a Streamlit web application that predicts drug-target binding affinity using a trained deep learning model. It processes drug SMILES strings and protein sequences as inputs and provides the predicted binding affinity.

## Features

- Accepts drug SMILES strings and protein sequences as inputs.
- Predicts binding affinity using a trained CNN model.
- User-friendly interface with clean and modern design.

## How It Works

- The user enters the drug's SMILES string and the protein sequence.
- The app tokenizes the inputs, pads them to a fixed length, and passes them to the trained model.
- The predicted binding affinity is displayed in the app.

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Streamlit
- Pickle
